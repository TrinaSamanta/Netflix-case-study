# Netflix-case-study
I have used MySQL workbench for this project, it has some meaningful insights which can help viewers to select movies or shows on Netflix. It can also suggest some valuavle genres to understand content localization trends, examine the popularity of characters and their impact on the success of titles.
By doing this I,m able to attain some insights---
correlation of IMDB scores with TMDB scores
Top actors appeared in the most titles
The number of titles released in each year
Distribution of IMDB scores for movies and tv shows
